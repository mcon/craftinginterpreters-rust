# A Rust implementation of craftinginterpreters' Lox language
![picture](https://travis-ci.org/mcon/craftinginterpreters-rust.svg?branch=master)

Currently a work in progress: as an attempt to learn Rust and more about compilers I'm writing a Rust implementaiton of the Lox language, as found at http://craftinginterpreters.com.

As this is a personal project to learn more about Rust, no PRs are accepted at this time.
